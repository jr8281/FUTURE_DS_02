This project focuses on analyzing social media advertising performance data to evaluate the effectiveness of digital marketing campaigns. 
Using a Facebook Ads dataset, an interactive Power BI dashboard was created to track key marketing KPIs such as impressions, clicks, ad spend, click-through rate (CTR), and cost per click (CPC).
The dataset was cleaned and prepared to handle data type inconsistencies, and DAX measures were developed to compute performance metrics dynamically. 
The dashboard provides insights into top-performing campaigns, engagement efficiency, and cost effectiveness, along with interactive filters that allow users to analyze performance across different campaigns and audience segments.
This project demonstrates hands-on experience in marketing analytics, KPI evaluation, dashboard interactivity, and data-driven optimization, closely reflecting real-world digital advertising analysis used by marketing teams.
